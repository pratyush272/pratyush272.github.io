Windows Advantages**

**

**Software Collection:** There is a much larger selection of available software programs, utilities, and games for Windows. More than the Operating System itself, this is the bigger reason for popularity of Windows. However that mean that Linux doesn’t have all the software that any average user (or even a professional for that matter) might need, it’s just that the Linux alternative might require relearning a new interface.    
The Linux variants for many of the popular softwares are made available by the respective company but quite often these variants are not as cutting edge and actively updated as their windows counterparts. The first thing that Windows refugees miss in Linux (apart from the _refresh_ option) is MS Office Suit.

_NOTE: There are some workarounds to run native Windows apps on Linux. Read more about that._
