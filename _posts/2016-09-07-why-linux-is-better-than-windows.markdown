Windows Advantages****

**

#### **

**Software Collection:** There is a much larger selection of available software programs, utilities, and games for Windows. More than the Operating System itself, this is the bigger reason for popularity of Windows. However that mean that Linux doesn’t have all the software that any average user (or even a professional for that matter) might need, it’s just that the Linux alternative might require relearning a new interface.    
The Linux variants for many of the popular softwares are made available by the respective company but quite often these variants are not as cutting edge and actively updated as their windows counterparts. The first thing that Windows refugees miss in Linux (apart from the _refresh_ option) is MS Office Suit.

_NOTE: There are some workarounds to run native Windows apps on Linux. Read more about that._

**Familiarity:**   
Although the major Linux variants have improved dramatically in ease of use, Windows is still much easier to use, for most part, because it is ubiquitous and you can find systems running windows anywhere you go. Most of the current generation has grown up with the same un-customizable task-bar and logo.

**Fool Proof: **
Windows hides almost all customization options (especially hardware customization). This is done mainly because since all major PC models are shipped with their own copy of windows, most of the settings are optimized for that particular hardware. This protects the windows from  tinkering that might harm the hardware if you don’t know what you are doing. eg. Overclocking the CPU might improve the performance but if done casually may burn your PC.

Linux Advantages (For average User)****

**

#### **

**Price:** All popular Linux variants (called Linux Distros) are available for free. Microsoft Windows can run between $50.00 – $150.00 US dollars per each license copy.

**Stable:** Most Linux Distros are very Stable and can often run for months and years without needing to be rebooted. Microsoft has improved a lot, but it still cannot match the reliability of Linux.

The Reliability and stability of Linux recommends it for all extreme tasks like Servers. 90% of Supercomputers run on Linux.

**Software Cost:** Many of the available software programs, utilities, and games available on Linux are freeware or open source. Even such complex programs such as Gimp (Photoshop alternative), OpenOffice (MS office alternative), Blender (3D Animation, Compositing and VFX tool), and Wine (a wrapper software to run native windows apps on Linux)  – are available for free. In windows, the majority of the programs will cost anywhere between $20.00 – $200.00+ US dollars per copy.

**Hardware Detection: ** Linux has excellent hardware detection. Especially Ubuntu Linux. You would never need to install any driver/Software for hardwares as varied as wireless mouse/ keyboards, printers, Scanners, Wacom tablets, USB 3G dongles. Just plug it in and it will be detected.

**Security:** Linux is and has always been a very secure operating system. Windows continues to be the most vulnerable to viruses and other attacks. It is really amusing how easy it is to install a spyware on a windows machine.

**Open Source:**  Microsoft Windows and the majority of Windows programs are not open source. Whereas many of the Linux Distros and softwares are open source and enable users to customize or modify the code however they want to, (and legally too). Though this is particularly exciting for those who aren’t scared of a little programming, this does showcase the generosity and open nature of Linux community.

**Support:** The peer support is absolutely amazing in Linux. Most of the problems that users might face has been dealt with hundreds of times for all Linux Distributions in various forums and all you need is google. Although it may be more difficult to find users familiar with all Linux variants, there are vast amounts of available online documentation and community support for Linux. Microsoft Windows is limited to its own help section, online documentation and customer support.
