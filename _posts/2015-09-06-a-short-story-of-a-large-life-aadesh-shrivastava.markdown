Aadesh Shrivastava got his first big break with film _Kanyadaan_ in the year 1993, infact Lata Mangeshkar sang his first song. But the film was never released.  The same thing happened with _Jaane Tamanna._

“Haathon Mein Aa Gaya Jo Kal” from the movie _Aao Pyaar Karen _was a hit. His song “Kya Ada Kya Jalwe Tere Paro” from the film _Shastra, was a chart-buster. _

He also doubled as a singer in some of his super hit songs such as “Sona sona”, “Shava Shava”, “Gustakhiyaan” and “Gur Nalon Ishq Mitha”.

In 2006, he turned to direction with his short film on child prostitution, “Sanaa”. In a 2009 movie called “_World Cupp 2011″, he _made a cameo.

On the international front Shrivastava collaborated with artists such as Akon, Julia Fordham, Wyclef Jean Dominic Miller, Shakira, and T-Pain. 

Together with Akon, he launched an India-wide talent search on the website www.hitlab.com which uses music analysis technology to predict the hit potential of new songs. 

Aadesh was married to Vijeta Pandit, the sister of Jatin Lalit and Sulakshana Pandit.

He was diagnosed with blood cancer in December 2010, went through chemotherapy , but after surviving many relapses, he finally succumbed to it on 4th of September, the day he was born. One full cycle. That is how perfectionists do it.

    < Rab Ke ‘Aadesh’ Ke Aage Kisiki Bhi Nahi Chalti.

 The melody of the voice of Amitabh Bachchan is now gone.
