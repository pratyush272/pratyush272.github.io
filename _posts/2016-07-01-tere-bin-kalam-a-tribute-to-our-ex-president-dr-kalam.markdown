Lyrics :-
—————————————-­—————————————-­————-
Ek aansu behene na diya
Shukriya tak kehne na diya
Soona laage re viran hai yeh jahan tere bin kalam

Dhadkane chalti rahi jab tak
Saadgi ka hi diya paigaam
Ab kya hoga vigyan aur dharm ka tere bin kalam

Ja na paate tum, Aise humse door
Desh jo na badnaseeb bekhabar hota
Laakhon hindu muslim, ki duaon par,
Allah ko bhi jhukna padta, ye asar hota
Soona laage re veeran hai ye jahan tere bin Kalam

Apne bande ko, vo hai bula leta,
par kya hota jo us khuda mein thoda sabar hota
Aakhiri Vidvaan, akhiri insaan,
akhiri ye kalam mera, akhiri salam
Soona laage re veera hai ye jahan tere bin Kalam

Former President APJ Abdul Kalam, the ‘missile man’ who came to be known as ‘People’s President’ died on 27th July, 2015 after he collapsed during a lecture at the IIM in Shillong in the evening.
Kalam suffered a massive cardiac arrest during the lecture. He was wheeled into the ICU of Bethany hospital in a critical condition.

Unarguably, the most popular Indian president, Kalam became the 11th head of the state and occupied the post between 2002 and 2007 but lack of consensus denied a second term in office for a man who came from outside political spectrum.

A seven-day national mourning was declared by the Centre. Both the Houses of Parliament were adjourned as a mark of respect to his memory.

Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam rose from humble origins to become the President in the most unexpected manner during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government. It is a pity that I had never heard about this legend before that.

An aeronautics engineer from Madras Institute of Technology, Kalam was considered the brain of missile programme in India. He also acted as the Chief Scientific Adviser to Vajpayee. He was also instrumental in the Pokhran nuclear test in 1998.

As President, Kalam never missed an opportunity to address students, especially school children, to dream big and become achievers in life.

He remained a bachelor. He never used a moment of his life for himself. He was a veena player and was deeply interested in Carnatic music.

He was vegetarian throughout his life.

Here is a small tribute to this person, this human being who was my one and only role model.
